# Teriyaki Chicken

## Ingredients
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 2 teaspoons water
* 1⁄4 cup white sugar
* 1⁄4 cup brown sugar
* 1⁄2 cup low sodium soy sauce
* 1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
* 1⁄4 cup orange juice or 1/4 cup pineapple juice
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 8 skinless chicken thighs

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Combine the first 10 ingredients in a bowl.

Place chicken pieces in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken and turn to thoroughly coat.

Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn pieces over, and bake for another 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear.

Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.

_*If using bone-in chicken breasts, bake at 375 for 35-40 minutes. If using boneless chicken breasts, bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes._

_*If you prefer (especially if you are cooking for a shorter amount of time), bring all the ingredients to a boil in a saucepan on the stove and let simmer until thick. Brush the chicken with the resulting glaze._
