# Beer cheese

## Ingredients
* 1 large Italian loaf
* 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
* 8 ounces (1 cup) lager or beer of choice, plus 1 tablespoon, divided
* 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 8 ounces swiss cheese, shredded
* 8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
* 10 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1/4 cup chopped mixed herbs (such as chives, parsley, and dill)
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* Chopped chives, to top
* Broccoli and pretzels to serve, optional

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to **375Â°F**.

Slice off the top of the bread. Hollow out the inside of the bread to create a bowl. Save the top of the bread for later.

In a large bowl, combine whisk together the softened cream cheese and 1 cup of the beer, until well-combined. Combine the remaining tablespoon of beer with 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Add the cornstarch slurry, the whole grain mustard, and the Worcestershire sauce to the cream cheese mixture and whisk again to combine. Fold in the shredded cheeses, then fold in the bacon. 

Fill the bread bowl with the cheese mixture. Transfer the bread bowl to a rimmed baking sheet.

Slice the top of the bread that was cut off earlier into thin pieces, and place them on the baking sheet, crust-side up.

In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, herbs, and olive oil. Spoon or brush the herb mixture onto the tops of the bread slices.

Bake the bread for 5 minutes, or just until the cheese is melted, stir, and continue to bake until the cheese begins to brown on top, about 30 minutes. If you notice that the bread slices begin to brown too much, cover them with foil as the beer cheese finishes cooking.

Top the dip with chopped chives and serve warm with the bread slices, broccoli, and pretzels.
