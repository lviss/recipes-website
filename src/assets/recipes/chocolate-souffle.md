# Chocolate Souffl√©

## Ingredients

* 8 oz good quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
* 4 tbsp butter (plus 1 tbsp more for coating the inside of the ramekins)
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large egg yolks
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided in half (plus 2 tbsp more for coating the inside of the ramekins)
* 6 large egg whites
* 1/4 tsp cream of tartar

## Instructions

1. Prepare 8 4oz. ramekins as follows: Coat the inside with softened or melted butter. Sprinkle some granulated sugar into each ramekin and shake it around to coat the inside completely. Place the buttered and sugared ramekins on a baking sheet and put in the refrigerator until ready to fill and bake.

2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

3. Fill a saucepan with water and bring to a low simmer. Put the chocolate and butter into a saucepan or bowl that is just smaller in size than the one you filled with water. Place the bowl of chocolate and butter over the boiling water and allow the chocolate and butter to melt, stirring constantly. Transfer the chocolate mixture to a large bowl, stir in the vanilla and salt, and allow to cool to room temperature.

4. Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar on high speed until the yolks are thickened and pale yellow, about 3-4 minutes. Gently stir the yolks into the room temperature chocolate.

5. If using the same mixing bowl to beat the egg yolks and egg whites, wash and dry it throughly. Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed until frothy. Sprinkle in the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. Beat until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks when the whisk is lifted away.

6. Gently fold about 1/4 of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten. Then fold the remaining egg whites into the chocolate in 2 additions, being as careful as you can to not deflate the beaten egg whites.

7. Remove the tray of ramekins from the refrigerator and divide the batter amongst them. Each ramekin will be full to the top with batter.

8. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes, until the souflees are puffed and the tops look dry.

9. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
