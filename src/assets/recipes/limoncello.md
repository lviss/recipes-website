# Limoncello

2 hours
## Ingredients

* 10 fresh lemons, preferably organic
* 4 cups vodka
* 4 cups water
* 2 cups sugar

## Directions

Set the Sous Vide Cooker to 135ºF (57ºC). 

Thoroughly wash lemons in hot water to remove wax and pat dry.

Using a zester or vegetable peeler, remove the zest in strips from the lemons, taking care to avoid any of the white pith. Save lemons for future use. 

Place zest strips in a large zipper lock bag with the vodka. Seal the bag using the water immersion technique and place the bag in the water bath. Set the timer for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, prepare the syrup: Heat water and sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir to dissolve sugar. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.

When the timer goes off, remove the bag from the water bath. Strain the entire contents of the bag through a fine mesh strainer set over a large pitcher or bowl. Stir in the syrup.

Transfer lemoncello to clean bottles with tight-fitting lids. Chill before serving in small glasses.
