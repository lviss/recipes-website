# Greek Chicken Bites

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. chicken breasts cut into 1" pieces (about 2 breasts)
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* juice and zest of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons juice and 1 teaspoon zest)
* 2 cloves garlic minced (about 1 teaspoon)
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup red wine or white wine or chicken broth, or water in a pinch

## Instructions

1. Make the marinade by mixing the olive oil (2 tablespoons), lemon juice and zest (from 1 lemon), minced garlic (2 cloves), dried oregano (2 teaspoons), kosher salt (1 teaspoon) and black pepper (1/2 teaspoon) together in a small bowl or glass measuring cup.

1. Put the cut up chicken breasts in a plastic bag or container with a lid. Pour the marinade over the chicken and stir to coat (or smush around in the plastic bag). Allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes, but preferably for 2-24 hours (you can skip this if you're in a hurry or didn't plan ahead).

1. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until very hot (this may take a few minutes if you are using cast iron, or only about 30 seconds to a minute if using another material).

1. Add the chicken to the skillet and spread out in an even layer. Cook without disturbing for about 5 minutes. Then, flip and cook on the other side for about 5 more minute, or until chicken is completely cooked (the internal temperature should be 165 degrees F, or cut into a piece to make sure it's not pink anymore).

1. Pour in the white wine (1/4 cup) and deglaze the bottom of the skillet, using a spatula or wooden spoon to loosen all the stuck-on browned bits while coating the chicken in them. Continue saut√©ing until most of the wine has evaporated and the chicken is coated in the deglazed drippings. Serve.

Notes
* If using a stainless steel or not well seasoned cast iron skillet, you may want to add 1 more tablespoon of olive oil to it before adding the chicken to prevent sticking.
* You can use the marinade and technique with another protein, such as chicken thighs, pork, steak tips, or shrimp. You may need to adjust cooking times depending on what you use.
* Ingredient substitutions: in a pinch, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar may be substituted for the lemon juice (and the zest omitted), and 1 teaspoon garlic powder substituted for the fresh minced garlic. Pre-mixed Greek seasoning or 1.5 tablespoons fresh oregano may be substituted for the dried oregano.
