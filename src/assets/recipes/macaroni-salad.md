# Macaroni salad

## Ingredients

* 8 oz macaroni noodles (227g)
* 1/2 cup finely diced sweet gherkins usually 4-6 sweet gherkins for me (80g)
* 3/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper about 1/2 pepper (100g)
* 1/3 cup thinly sliced celery about 1-2 stalks (55g)
* 1/3 cup finely diced red onion (45g)
* 2 large hard boiled eggs, finely diced

### Macaroni Salad Dressing:

* 3/4 cup mayonnaise I use olive oil mayo (175g)
* 1/4 cup sour cream (70g)
* 2 Tablespoons sweet pickle juice
* 1 Tablespoon red wine vinegar*
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons dijon mustard
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper optional

## Instructions

Prepare macaroni noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse immediately with cold water, then drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil and gently stir so the noodles don't stick together as they sit.

In a large bowl, combine macaroni noodles, sweet pickles, red pepper, celery, red onion, and eggs. Stir until well-combined. Set aside and prepare your dressing.

### For the dressing

To prepare your macaroni salad dressing, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, red wine vinegar, sweet pickle juice, sugar, dijon mustard, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk until ingredients are well-combined.

Pour dressing over your macaroni salad ingredients and toss until well-combined.

For best flavor, cover bowl and allow macaroni salad to chill for at least one hour. Stir once more before serving and enjoy!

Notes

_*If you don't have red wine vinegar on hand, white wine or apple cider vinegar would also work well._
